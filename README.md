# :jigsaw: Experience

Passionate about technology and problem-solving, I am a student of Systems Development, eager to explore the vast world of software engineering. As I embark on this journey, I am building a solid foundation in Python, C, HTML, and CSS, with a particular interest in web development and backend programming.

Beyond coding, I enjoy collaborating on projects, refining my skills with Git and GitHub, and learning from the developer community. My goal is to not only master the technical aspects but also to understand how technology can create meaningful and efficient solutions.
