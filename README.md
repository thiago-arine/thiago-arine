# :jigsaw: Experience

Passionate about technology and problem-solving, I am a Systems Development student eager to explore the vast world of software engineering. As I embark on this journey, I am building a solid foundation in Python, C, HTML, and CSS, with a particular interest in web development and backend programming.

Beyond coding, I enjoy collaborating on projects, refining my skills with Git and GitHub, and learning from the developer community. I aim to master the technical aspects and understand how technology can create meaningful and efficient solutions.
